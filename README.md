 - Retweet: a link is formed when a user retweets another user (directed network)
 - Mention-Network: a link is formed when a user mentions another user (directed network)
 - Co-Mention-Network: when two ore more users are mentioned in the same tweet (undirected network)
 - Hashtag-Network: when two or more hashtags appear in the same tweet (undirected network)
